    <h2>Keep a Dream Journal</h2>
    <p>I personally have a dream journal. What you do, is that 
    you document your dreams from the morning you wake up. Documenting
    your dreams help with memory retention and increase
    the vivdity of your dreams. My personal experience with this has
    given me benefits. Ever since I started journaling my dreams, my dreams 
    have become much more easier to remember and in much greater vividity.</p>

    <h2>Do Reality Checks</h2>
    <p>Reality checks are basically actions throughout the day that you
    perform in order to check if you are dreaming. Doing reality checks
    help due to how a person doing these checks will be so frequent that 
    they do it in their dreams. These reality checks can be from pinching
    yourself, holding your breath, looking in a mirror, and trying to 
    push your finger against your palm.</p>
    <h2>Meditation</h2>
    <p>I personally have not meditated much for lucid dreaming but 
    I have heard people meditating in order to remeber their dreams.
    So, maybe give meditating a try.</p>
