    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p><em>Lucid dreaming is when someone becomes self aware that they are 
    dreaming. Once you are aware that you are dreaming, you are able
    to control it.</em></p>

  <h2>
    Methods
  </h2>
  <p><em>These are used to aid a person in achieving a state of 
  lucidity within their dreams.</em></p>
  <br>
  <p><b>FILD</b> <em> Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming</em></p>
  <p>This method requires for a person to wake up between 4-6 hours
  after they have fallen asleep. People usually set up an alarm clock
  in order to wake them up. Once the person wakes up from their alarm
  they fall back asleep while moving their index and middle finger
  up and down. This motion can be described as if pressing key on a
  computer. They continue to do this till they have fallen asleep. 
  Though, it might not not feel like 
  you fell asleep, which is why you would have to do a reality 
  check as soon as you are aware you are dreaming.</p>

  <p><b>MILD</b> <em>Mneumonic Induced Lucid Dreaming</em></p>
  <p>Before a person goes to sleep they repeat affirmations till 
  they are asleep. These affirmations can be things like: "I am 
  lucid dreaming", "I will lucid dream tonight", "I am aware
  that I am dreaming". And so on. So, repeat these affirmations

  <p><b>WILD</b> <em>Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming</em></p>
  <p>This method is advanced and requires some concentration. Like
  some methods, you will have to wake up 3-6 hours after you have 
  slept. Once you wake up, stay up for a few mintues and try relaxing
  as much as possible since you will be going back to sleep. As you
  are going to sleep, you will see images forming if you are 
  successfull.It is noted that once you start seeing colors, do not
  interact with them just yet. You can finally interact with you
  dream once the dream becomes clearer then you can start controlling
  it.</p>

  <br>
  <p><b>VILD</b> <em>Visually Induced Lucid Dreaming</em></p>
  <p>This method requires for you to make up a scenario that 
  you can experince in your dream. Through out the day you should
  solidify a certain scenario and say affirmations such as "I will
  dream out xyz". Also, this is really important, you should include
  a reality check within your scenario. For example, you can have 
  someone within your dream to tell you to do a reality check or 
  once you see a ceratin object you will do a reality check. Then 
  before you go to sleep you imagine the scenario and fall asleep.</p>

  <p><b>WBTB</b> <em>Wake Back To Bed</em></p>
  <p>Set an alarm 1 hour before you wake up. Once you wake up you
  should have a scenario you would want to dream about. Stay up
  for an hour, because this a good way to make yourself tired and 
  fall asleep. Once you are preparing to sleep, you should affirm 
  you will dream the scenario you want and it should happen if
  successfull.</p>

  <p><b>RAUSIS</b></p>
  <p>You have to set up an alarm 3-6 hours after you have slept.
  Once you are awake you have to set another alarm for 3-5 
  minutes. Once it is set, immediately go to sleep.
  The purpose of this alarm is so that you can hear it while 
  you are dreaming and it will be a siganl for you to realize 
  that you are dreaming.</p>
