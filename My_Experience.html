    <h2>The Experience</h2>
    <p>To get to straight to the point, personally when I am on the 
    verge of lucid dreaming or am in a lucid state. My dreams become 
    very vivid and can remember a lot from my dreams of the 
    morning when I wake up. During that night, I had about multiple 
    dreams and I could remember them in great detail. I won't really
    go into detail of what happened in my other dreams since it 
    is irrelevant to The Dream I am about to talk about.</p>
    <p>In short, I was able to realize I was dreaming when I realized 
    I was not dead. In my dream, I was shot at by Beautrix from <em>
      Harry Potter</em>. When she tried to avracadavra me with her wand
      I didn't die. The spell went straight through me. Though, her
      spell killed someone within my dream, I believe it was Dean, 
      also from <em>Harry Potter</em>. The reason I was shot at by her 
      was because I jumped in front of Dean in order to protect him.
      </p>
      <p>In that instance I realized I wasn't dead. I immediately 
      started waterbending. If you are wondering, the method I 
      tried was the MILD. To be completely honest, this lucid dream
      caught me off guard since I was not really trying to have a 
      lucid dream that night.</p>
      <p>This experience was so fun, I can never forget it. Once I started
      waterbending, my skills were sorta iffy in the beginning. In my dream
      there was a lake nearby so that was how I drew water to bend. At first, 
      I formed a ball of water and you could tell it was hard for me to 
      hold it together. I could see the water spill out on the sides and 
      was quivering as if it was about to fall apart. At that moment, it 
      took me great concentration to hold it together, but I let it go
      since I was excited to bend other elements.</p>
      <p>I tried earthbending and it was fun. Though, at first it was hard 
      for me to bend it for some reason. I remember outstretching my
      hands and looking at the ground anticipating for it to move at 
      my will. It did not, so I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.
      I repeated the phrase "I can earthbend" over and over, AND IT 
      ACTUALLY WORKED. I was so enthralled to see a boulder levitating off
      the ground. I tried some other moves such as moving pieces of the Earth
      upwards, sorta like a spike.</p>
      <p>As cheessy as it may sound, if you are having troubles controlling
      your dream while you are lucid. You have to believe that you can control
      it. It worked out for me, so I believe anyone can have that type of 
      control as much as I did in my first lucid dream. Also, you can go crazy
      as much as you want. Like making large structures in your dreams and
      such. You honestly have no limitations. I mean, I made a huge stadium 
      right after I could levitate that boulder. I think I was just really
      excited that it worked at the time.</p>
      <p>As I said before, I immediately made a huge stadium out of the 
      Earth using Earth bending. The stadium looked like the colosseum.
      From where I was standing I launched off the ground using airbending
      and could see everything from above. If you have seen Avatar: The
      Last Airbender you will completely understand what I'm going to describe.
      Once I was near the surface, I made a ball of air and sat on it. With
      that ball of air I was propelling myself around the whole stadium
      while sitting crossed. As I was sitting on the ball of air, I would
      use my other elemental powers. I would waterbend, earthbend, and 
      firebend in a lot of directions. Sort of like in a punching motion,
      with each hit an element of my choosing would shoot forth.</p>
      <p>Then from there some things happened like I saw random 
      people at the stadium and the stadium suddenly turned into an
      icing rink at the bottom. Then my dream felt sort of blurry if 
      that makes sense, like it got fuzzy and it ended.</p>
